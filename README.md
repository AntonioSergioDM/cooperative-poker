## The idea behind the example
We wanted to play a nice, realistic Cooperative Poker game online.

We used React, Next and Socket.IO.

## What's next?

Create a pull request to resolve an issue and submit it to review :)

- I need to clone the socket io admin to this project because of the CORS policy
